### Day 0: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reading rules; setting up twitter follow

**Thoughts:** A bit anxious about this commitment -- lots going on, and as a retiree out of the habit of dailies.  Completed "Learn Python the hard way" last year; think I'll stay with Python for now and try to actually write something in it.  Using basic setup from HardWay -- Atom editor, powershell, Python 2.8

Need to do the following:  
    review GitHub training
    get up test website on localhost.  Review Python setup.  Find next level Python training.
    Pick a project.

**Link to work:** None yet -- today's task is think of a project to start with tomorrow (harder than you might think!)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
