# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reading rules; setting up twitter follow

**Thoughts**: A bit anxious about this commitment -- lots going on, and as a retiree out of the habit of dailies.  Completed "Learn Python the hard way" last year; think I'll stay with Python for now and try to actually write something in it.  Using basic setup from HardWay -- Atom editor, powershell, Python 2.8

Need to do the following:  

    review GitHub training

    get up test website on localhost.  Review Python setup.  Find next level Python training.

    Pick a project.
    

**Link to work:** None yet -- today's task is think of a project to start with tomorrow (harder than you might think!)

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Settled on Python Projects by Alan Gauld; Laura Cassell; working thru chapter 1. 

got local host fixed with test site.

Installed Python 3 and selected next Python book.

Still need project -- hopefully in Chapter 1, but if not have a few ideas.  Could restart Zork-like game code for an hour if nothing else.

**Thoughts**:

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
